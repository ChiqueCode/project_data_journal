            Income usually associated with morbidity and mortality
            across the income distribution. Income strongly influences health through
            various behavioral, clinical, social, and environmental
            systems. Isolating the unique contribution of income to
            health can be difficult because this relationship intersects
            with many other social risk factors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examining the links between income and health is increasingly
            important, given current economic trends and growing income
            inequality in the United States.

          <p>
            It’s also clear that while low income contributes to poor health
            status, poor health can also contribute to lower income. Poor
            health can limit one’s ability to work, reduce economic
            opportunities, inhibit educational attainment, and lead to
            medical debt and bankruptcy. This can create a negative feedback
            loop—what Jacob Bor and Sandro Galea have called
            <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2017/04/25/the-cost-economic-inequality-nation-physical-health/JTsEP3XkNx3425ypbw4KRI/story.html"

          <p>
            Policy initiatives that supplement income and improve
            educational opportunities, housing prospects, and social
            mobility and can reduce poverty and lead to downstream health
            effects not only for low-income people but also for those in the
            middle class. You can see the heatmap below with density of
            colleges displayed across the US.

          The complex relationship between low educational attainment,
          low income, and higher risk of disease and early death has
          likely grown stronger in an increasingly global and
          information-driven economy. Studies show that
          Americans at all income levels are less healthy than those with incomes higher than their own. See
          below the
          interactvie visualization that would show the correlation between Healthcare, Poverty and Income
