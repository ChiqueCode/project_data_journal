            <h2>Income And Health — The Evidence</h2>
            <p>
              Income is strongly associated with morbidity and mortality across
              the income distribution. Income influences health through various
              clinical, behavioral, social, and environmental mechanisms.
              Isolating the unique contribution of income to health can be
              difficult because this relationship intersects with many other
              social risk factors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Policy initiatives that supplement income and improve educational
              opportunities, housing prospects, and social mobility and can
              reduce poverty and lead to downstream health effects not only for
              low-income people but also for those in the middle class. You can
              see the heatmap below with density of colleges displayed across
              the US.

              />
            </p>

            <p>
              Examining the links between income and health is increasingly
              important, given current economic trends and growing income
              inequality in the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s also clear that while low income contributes to poor health
              status, poor health can also contribute to lower income. Poor
              health can limit one’s ability to work, reduce economic
              opportunities, inhibit educational attainment, and lead to medical
              debt and bankruptcy. This can create a negative feedback loop—what

                Americans at all income levels are less healthy than those with incomes higher than their own. See below the interactvie visualization that would show the correlation between Healthcare, Poverty and Income Rate across United States.
